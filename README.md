# Advanced Financial Portfolio Evaluation and Forecasting System

Welcome to the Advanced Financial Portfolio Evaluation and Forecasting System. This sophisticated project is designed to offer a holistic view and forward-looking insights into a diversified financial portfolio. It integrates real-time financial data from leading cryptocurrencies and traditional stock and bond markets, providing a multi-dimensional analysis of an investor's assets. Through cutting-edge Monte Carlo simulations, the system projects the potential growth of the portfolio, empowering investors with strategic foresight to optimize their investment decisions.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Dynamic Cryptocurrency Wallet Assessment**: Harnessing the power of the Requests library, this feature dynamically retrieves real-time price information for leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. It meticulously calculates the total value of the cryptocurrency wallet, offering up-to-the-minute financial insights.

- **Stock and Bond Portfolio Analysis**: Leveraging the Alpaca Trade API, this module obtains historical closing prices for pivotal market instruments like SPY (stocks) and AGG (bonds). It intelligently computes the total value of these holdings, presenting a consolidated view of the investor's traditional market investments.

- **Emergency Fund Viability Check**: This critical functionality evaluates the comprehensive value of the entire portfolio against a predefined emergency fund target. It provides essential feedback on the fund's adequacy, ensuring financial resilience and preparedness.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation for Long-term Forecasting**: At the core of the system lies an advanced Monte Carlo simulation process, which projects the future performance of the portfolio over a span of 30 years, based on a 60/40 stocks to bonds allocation. It includes detailed visualizations of simulation outcomes and probability distributions, offering a strategic planning tool for long-term investment growth.

- **Retirement Portfolio Projections**: This feature refines the Monte Carlo simulation to focus on a 10-year return forecast, adjusting the portfolio to an 80/20 stocks to bonds ratio. It explores the feasibility of achieving early retirement goals through strategic investment reallocation, providing actionable insights for life planning.
